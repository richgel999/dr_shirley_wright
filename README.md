# Dr. Shirley Jean Wright PhD - 8/19/1929 - 7/1/2015

This repo contains public record evidence showing the academic and educational accomplishments of Dr. Shirley Jean Wright PhD, a student of Dr. Albert Einstein at Princeton, NJ in the Summer of 1947. She would have been 17 years, 10 months, 18 days old in July 7, 1947.

(Note to anyone who thinks a 17 year old couldn't or wouldn't accompany a famous scientist to a military base: June Crain was 17 years old when she began working at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.)

## Basics: Full Name, Birth Date/Location and Death Date/Location

Dr. Wright's chemistry [1955 MS thesis Vita](https://github.com/richgel999/dr_shirley_wright/blob/main/ms_thesis_vita.pdf) contains all the basic information we need to verify that we've got the right person. Right here we can see that right after graduating high school she started at Barry College (with a scholarship according to newspaper records) in Sept. 1947:<br>
